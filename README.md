## What is it?
Almeida_DB_project is a database management application built with Python and SQLite, designed to query, manage, and analyze data using SQL.

## Why are you doing this?
Because I'm currently doing a course about Data-Bases and to improve my experiences with this tecnology is needed a project about this topic.

## What is needed to play this project?
Python - 3.13.9 is currently been used by me
SQLite - Is integrated with python

### Obs:
I used SQLite because is more light and do not need a servidor in a small project like this.
